WordSolver is a fun way to play games such as Scrabble and Words With Friends while being able to focus on strategy such as board position. 
After entering your tiles and a small amount of information about what letters to build from, WordSolver will tell you all of the words which you can build. 
It allows you to use wildcards, and even perform some more advanced placements bridging multiple letters on a game board.

Don't Cheat! Let your friends know that you are using WordSolver so that they can use it too!
